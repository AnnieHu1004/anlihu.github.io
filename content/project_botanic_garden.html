                        We teamed up together with St Andrews Botanic Garden in their pursuit to refresh the scientific
                        mission and overall purpose for professionals and visitors alike. However, at the outset of the
                        project, we didn’t have a clear vision or specific goals about what we gonna build. Without
                        pre-existing insights, we decided to visit the garden in person to get an idea of what this
                        garden feels like.
                        <br><br>
                        Due to requirements from the university, we could not interview our client in person during the
                        pandemic. Even so, this visit provided us with a perfect chance to explore the garden as a pure
                        visitor, allowing us to find out how to work with data and information in the garden.

                        Having constructed three unique User Work Roles and a comprehensive Flow Model based on the data
                        gathered, we decided to approach analysing the needs and challenges of the project from one
                        final direction: through User Personas. These were designed to contrast the very specific and
                        mechanical user work roles, and to essentially get an outside-the-box understanding of the
                        actual users of the web portal.

                        at the problem from a more personal and empathetic perspective.

                    While there are multiple users and stakeholders involved with the Web Portal, and there is limited
                    time to implement the project, we mainly limited our attention to the user experience of the
                    <strong>managers</strong> and <strong>general staff</strong>. As the highest priority users of the
                    web portal, ensuring they have
                    smooth and seamless experiences with data queries and manipulations, the outsider can also benefit
                    from this.
                    <br><br>
                    To help us visualise and communicate our areas of interest, we sketched storyboards first, which
                    described and reminded us of the <em>what, when, where and how</em>.

                            scenarios depicted in storyboards, we applied our ideas and the client’s wishes from the
                            mood board and user research insights to create concept sketches.

                            future design and development. Hence, we focused on essential modules, including data

                            While common and highly convenient, QR code nevertheless comes with the flaw of having to
                            print out tags for each plant if used.
                            ‍<br><br>
                            As a complement method, we came up with the idea of using neural networks and image
                            recognition to search the database by simply pointing your phone’s camera at a plant. For
                            implementation, Google Lens already makes such a feat possible and could therefore be
                            utilised.

                    <p class="paragraph-light">
                        A question the team asked itself during the sketching process was how can we help the general
                        visitor with little to no experience with plants? While the QR code and image recognition were
                        possible for mobile users, the team wanted to find something similarly intuitive for desktop
                        users as well.
                        <br><br>
                        We offered our client a possible solution for this. The intuitive search method, an out-of-box
                        idea that aims to provide inspiration for the client instead of a function that can be developed
                        right away, is based on visuals rather than scientific attributes. What size of a plant are you
                        looking for? What colour is it? an choose between different physical attributes of the plant and
                        as they make their choices, the image cards on the right-hand side update dynamically. The user
                        can of course click on one of the cards and thus access more information about the plant.

                    First, I want to thank my teammates as we've done great teamwork together. All of us were keen to
                    design a prototype that met our client's requirements and exceeded their expectations, and we were
                    all each other backup.
                    <br><br>
                    For me, the whole design process is very fulfilling. I applied what I had learned from the course to
                    a practical project step by step, turning users' needs and insights we gathered from user searches
                    into different prototypes. Although this project met the client's needs, it left much desired in
                    terms of industry perspective. It consists of different modules without a well-established
                    information architecture and is designed with three different software, and lacked a consistent
                    design system due to time constraints. It does not mean I will just leave it there but incorporate
                    them into my future projects.
