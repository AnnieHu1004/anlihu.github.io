                                more customers with different accessibilities, and benefit 2B users.</p>

                        When I was thinking about whether the target user groups have any difference between the website
                        and mobile application, some scenarios came into my mind.
                        <br><br>
                        They still can cover a wide range of users group, across different ages and occupations.
                        However, customers who use App, the ones with a higher threshold of use, are easier to develop
                        user loyalty; while customers who use websites sometimes tend to have a one-shot deal. For
                        example, if a tourist searches for a restaurant on Google, Eatant's page for the restaurant is
                        shown at the top of all search results.
                        <br><br>
                        In another word, customers have similar needs but different consumption and usage preferences.

                        Before starting sketching, I did the same competitive audit on the websites of the three
                        competitors of the mobile applications. It is quite consistent that they all have more booking
                        steps than mobile applications. As websites for desktops and tablets have the ability to display
                        more information, users could easily be distracted, they all show information confirmation
                        pages. Compared to mobile applications, they also design clearer user flows, allowing users to
                        book restaurants more naturally with less doubts in their minds.

                            Despite browsing and using various websites every day, designing a website is still an
                            unfamiliar field for me. It is an excellent chance for me to learn common website layouts
                            and identify benefits and drawbacks of each layout to choose the most suitable one for
                            Eatant.
                            <br><br>
                            During sketching, I tried several versions of the homepage and draw a final homepage design
                            with the best elements chosen from the other sketches. This helped me visualize my wanted
                            orientation for designing Eatant's website.

                        After having all the digital wireframes for the desktop, I created a low-fidelity prototype and

                        then booking it.
                        <br><br>
                        The good news is all participants completed the task successfully and shared almost the same
                        click path. However, there was still some confusion for users as they tended to click the
                        grayscale "BOOK NOW" button before they fill in all the needed information. ( The problem is
                        participants could not tell it's unclickable until they are at the final step!)

                        It is true that the website can automatically select "Sign me up to receive dining offers and
                        news from Eatant by email." for customers when they are submiting their appointment. However, we
                        all remember the annoyance when we open our email and find receiving countless promotion emails.
                        In this case, Eatant provides different ways to guide customers and increase retention.
