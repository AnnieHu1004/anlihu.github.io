                    Utilizing a slightly dark but not dull red felt like the perfect fit for Eatant's branding. It helps

                    feeling to using the app. The main typeface of choice for the app is SF Pro. I felt this typeface
                    fit the app well due to its versatility through uppercase and lowercase styling, as well as bold and
                    light text fills.

                    I had the chance to go through the whole designing process and this allowed me to realize my own
                    shortages. During the research and design phases, I kept telling myself that the first thing to
                    avoid bias and stereotypes is to realize them. Even though I wrote to remind me, bias still showed
                    up. It's a long way to go indeed.

                    The first idea coming up for the app is only the beginning of the process. Usability studies and
                    peer feedback influenced each iteration of the design. And the design can always go better to become
                    more user-centred.
