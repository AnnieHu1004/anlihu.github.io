                            Sign Your Pixels is a public-faced interactive installation. With a motivation to explore a
                            new relationship between the human and the computer- machines would actively interact with
                            the public rather than passively wait to be activated, it is designed to allow multiple
                            users from different places to draw on the same pixel canvas and communicate with each
                            other.

                            interaction. Users could not only manipulate the canvas and draw pixels with various colours
                            but also could interact with pixels drawn by other users in the past to create a piece of
                            artwork together.

                        The figure below shows the ways to interact with the prototype. The ultrasonic sensor is built
                        upon
                        a servo so that it could continuously rotate to detect the surrounding conditions (part B of
                        figure
                        1). By pressing the history button, users could revisit the history record drawn by other users
                        (part A). Part C to F shows different functions that users have.

                    <p class="paragraph-light">
                        Whenever the installation detects someone around the device, it would randomly play a sound that
                        says, "Hey, come here. Let's create a great creation!". If it detects someone standing in front
                        of the screen, the camera turns on and activates its face recognition. The interface would
                        switch
                        to the painting canvas when a face is detected, and the user can manipulate the hardware to
                        complete a series of tasks.
                        <br><br>
                        Each user has two minutes to paint, and when that time is up, a QR code would be generated on
                        the left side of the screen, which the user can scan to download their work and track record.
                        The
                        pixels drawn by the user cannot be undone but may be overwritten by other users. The user can
                        return to
                        the device and continue drawing.

                            This interactive installation is expected to be placed in multiple locations on campus or in
                            different art museums, encouraging active interaction between the machine and the human, and
                            exploring the possibility of multi-user collaboration in creating art. It can also help
                            study
                            users’ mentality since users may choose to return to their nearest installation multiple
                            times,
                            especially when they find their work being changed. Currently, this prototype is running on
                            a
                            local server; in the future, it will become an online platform that allows multiple users to
                            paint interactively at different installations. In addition, users who are painting at the
                            same
                            time can communicate remotely via camera and work together collaboratively.

                            Now people have photos, videos, and maps to record their travels, and they recall or share
                            their experiences with friends by reviewing these media. However, people barely remember
                            what they have browsed on the Internet even though they spend hours on it every day.
                            <br><br>
                            Hence, with a motivation to explore a new way to record users’ online wanderings and a
                            uniquely immersive experience of browsing websites, Netnet was created. It is an online
                            journey recorder, that could map data into different forms, such as colours, sounds and
                            numbers. Using this designed hardware, users could review their online journeys in a fun and
                            meaningful way, help them realize the overmuch time they have spent on the Internet and
                            remind them to turn off their electronic devices to rest.

                                The night mode is a way to help users control their time using electronic devices. If

                                prototype would show red lights to alert users. As time spent using electronic devices
                                increases, the number of lit lamps will also increase.

                            After the Explosion is a two-player cooperative shooting game. With a motivation to
                            explore a new form of shooting beyond the traditional shooting game and design a game
                            that could enhance the sense of communication and cooperation between players, this game
                            was born.
                            <br><br>
                            It is set in a catastrophic event where players need to find their companions and lead
                            them to their new homeland after the Earthexplosion. Supported by multiple sensors
                            provided in the micro: bit, such as accelerometer and touch sensor, players can play
                            this computer game by manipulating the hardware and engaging themselves in the game
                            through multi-dimensional outputs and feedback.

                                Players could slowly recover when they are not under attack. Hence, players need to
                                cover each other as the game can only be won if both players reach their new
                                homeland alive.

                                will follow them around, or they can send out signals to gather more companions to
                                where they are.

                            Finding more companions means they are more vulnerable to enemy attacks. In this case,
                            there is a trade-off about when and how to find their companions or players can even
                            sacrifice them to protect themselves from enemy attacks if necessary. When players both
                            reach the finishing line, they can unlock different game endings depending on the number
                            of companions they have found.
